        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> (One day in advance) Place the dried chickpeas and baking soda in a <em>large bowl</em> filled with water to cover the chickpeas by at least 2 inches. Soak overnight <strong>for 18 hours (longer  if the chickpeas are still too hard).</strong> When ready, drain the chickpeas completely and pat them dry.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add the<strong> chickpeas, herbs, onions, garlic and spices to the large bowl of a blender fitted with a blade</strong>. Run the blender<em> 40 seconds at a time</em> until all is well combined forming a the falafel mixture.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong>Transfer the falafel mixture to a <strong>container and cover tightly. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or (up to one whole night) until ready to cook.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Just before frying, add the baking powder and sesame seeds to the falafel mixture and stir with a spoon.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Scoop tablespoonfuls of the falafel mixture and form into patties <em>(1/2 inch in thickness each).</em> <strong>It helps to have wet hands as you form the patties.</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Fill a medium saucepan 3 inches up with oil. Heat the oil on medium-high <em>until it bubbles softly.</em> Carefully drop the falafel patties in the oil, let them fry for <strong>about 3 to 5 minutes</strong> or so until crispy and medium brown on the outside. Avoid crowding the falafel in the saucepan, fry them in batches if necessary.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong>Place the fried falafel patties in a colander or plate lined with paper towels to drain. </p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat the oven to <em>425 degrees</em> Fahrenheit. If desired, line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> <strong>On the baking sheet, toss the cauliflower with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil until lightly and evenly coated in oil.</strong> Arrange the cauliflower in a single layer and sprinkle lightly with salt. Bake until the cauliflower is tender and caramelized on the edges,<em> 25 to 35 minutes,</em> tossing halfway.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the cauliflower is almost done, in a <em>Dutch oven or soup pot</em>, warm the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion and ¼ teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened and turning translucent,<em> 5 to 7 minutes.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> <strong>Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds, then add the broth.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Reserve 4 of the prettiest roasted cauliflower florets for garnish. Then transfer the remaining cauliflower to the pot. Increase the heat to <em>medium-high</em> and bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, for <em>20 minutes,</em> to give the flavors time to meld.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> <strong>Once the soup is done cooking, remove the pot from the heat and let it cool for a few minutes.</strong> Then, carefully transfer the hot soup to a blender, working in batches if necessary. (Do not fill past the maximum fill line or the soup could overflow!)
</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Add the butter and blend until smooth. Add the lemon juice and nutmeg and blend again. Add additional salt, to taste (I usually add another ¼ to ¾ teaspoon, depending on the broth). This soup tastes amazing once it’s properly salted! You can also a little more lemon juice, if it needs more zing. Blend again.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Top individual bowls of soup with 1 roasted cauliflower floret and a sprinkle of chopped parsley, green onion and/or chives. This soup keeps well in the refrigerator, covered, for about four days, or for several months in the freezer.

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <em>If using jarred grape leaves</em>, rinse the brine using <em>cold water</em> and set aside to drain any water.<br>
For fresh grape leaves, boil for 2 minutes before rinsing. <strong>Set aside to cool before using.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Prepare the filling for the grape leaves by chopping all your washed vegetables. Drain the excess juices from the chopped tomato.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong>Wash the short-grained rice thoroughly until water runs clear. In a large bowl, add the finely chopped parsley, mint leaves, onion, tomato and rice.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> <em>Juice 2</em> of the lemons and add to the filling mixture, along with<strong> ½ cup of olive oil, one teaspoon of salt, and ½ teaspoon of black pepper. Mix well to combine.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Lay out the grape leaf with<strong> the vein-side up </strong>(shiny side down). Remove the stem if it is not already removed. Add 1-2 tablespoons of filling <em>depending on the size of the grape leaf and arrange in a thin line</em>. You want to leave at least 1 cm of room on each side. Be careful not to overfill.<br>
Fold each side of the leaf over the filling beginning with the bottom side and roll <em>tightly to prevent the leaf from opening up while cooking</em>. Repeat until you have no more leaves left. If the grape leaf is very large, cut in half, then stuff and roll.
</p>

<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Peel and wash the large potato and slice in <em>1 cm slices</em>. Slice the medium tomato the same size. Lay the tomato slices first, then the potato slices on the bottom of a deep pot.<br>
Arrange the stuffed grape leaves side by side and on top of each other over the potatoes. Sprinkle the remaining two teaspoons of salt over the grape leaves. <strong>Juice the remaining lemon and add it to the pot, along with the ¼ of olive oil remaining and leftover juices from the filling</strong>.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Place a plate about 1-2 inches smaller in diameter than the pot, over the stuffed leaves. Fill the pot with enough water to cover all the leaves and up to the plate. Place a <strong>heavy item on top of the plate to prevent the grape leaves from opening up while cooking</strong>.
Cook on medium heat for 30 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, and cover with a lid and cook for a remaining 45 minutes. To check if grape leaves are done, take a grape leaf out and try it! </p> 

<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Once the grape leaves are done cooking and have cooled for<em> at least 15 minutes</em>, flip the pot over onto a serving platter. There should be a little bit of lemon water juices left. Serve warm or cold.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to <em> 500 degrees Fahrenheit</em> with a rack in the upper third of the oven.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> <strong>Whisk water, oil, honey and yeast in a liquid measuring cup or small bowl.</strong> Allow yeast to proof for 5 minutes. It should puff up some by then.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pulse <em>flour, Parmesan, and salt in food processor</em> until combined. While running the food processor, slowly pour in the water mixture and process until a <em>shaggy ball forms, about 1 minute.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Dump the dough onto a floured work surface and quickly knead dough a few times until it comes together. Halve the dough.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> On a floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll dough into two rounds about 11 inches in diameter. For best results, roll the dough out about as thin as reasonably possible. Aim for even thickness rather than a perfectly round shape.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Carefully lift and transfer one of the rounds onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush the outer 1-inch of the dough with a light coating of olive oil. Add half of the pizza sauce or crushed tomatoes (crush the tomatoes over the sink to get out as much liquid as possible). Sprinkle with half of the cheese and any other toppings you’d like to add.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Bake on the top rack until the crust and cheese are lightly golden, for about 12 minutes. Repeat with the remaining dough, then slice and serve. Leftover pizza will keep well in the refrigerator for about 4 days.

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need a <strong>large 9×13-inch baking pan/dish with at least a 12-14 cup capacity.</strong> Set aside and have ready to go!
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You will form <em>2 layers each of dipped ladyfingers and mascarpone cream</em>. Let’s begin with the 1st layer of ladyfingers. Whisk the espresso and together in a shallow bowl. One at a time, quickly dip each side of the ladyfinger into the espresso mixture. You don’t want to over-saturate the ladyfinger with liquid because then the ladyfingers will taste soggy. Just a quick dip on each side. Arrange the dipped ladyfingers in the baking pan to make one solid layer. If needed, cut some ladyfingers to fill in any empty spaces. Reserve remaining espresso mixture and ladyfingers for another layer.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the mascarpone and rum together on <em>medium speed</em> in a large bowl for a few seconds, just to combine. Do not overmix. Set aside.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> If you have a double boiler, use it in this step. If you don’t, place a heatproof bowl over a small pot of simmering water over medium-low heat.<strong> Don’t let the water touch the bottom of the bowl.  Using a whisk or eggbeater (I simply use a whisk), whisk the egg yolks and 1/4 cup (50g) of granulated sugar together until light and foamy, about 5 minutes.</strong> Remove from the heat and immediately pour into the mascarpone mixture. Beat on medium speed until combined.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the heavy cream and vanilla extract together on <em>medium-high speed until medium peaks form, about 3 minutes.</em> Medium peaks are between soft/loose peaks and stiff peaks and are the perfect consistency for the tiramisu cream. Fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong>With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a clean whisk attachment, beat the egg whites and salt together on medium-high speed until foamy, about 1 minute. <strong>Increase to high speed and slowly pour in the remaining 1/4 cup (50g) of sugar. Beat until stiff peaks form, about 4-5 minutes. (Do not over-beat as the egg whites will become dry.)</strong> Fold into the mascarpone cream.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Spread half of the mascarpone cream evenly over bottom layer of ladyfingers. <em>An offset spatula helps spread it neatly and evenly.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Dip remaining ladyfingers into remaining espresso mixture and arrange one-by-one on top of the mascarpone layer. Gently press each down so they are nice and compact. Using an offset spatula, spread remaining mascarpone mixture evenly on top. If you’re using a large enough pan, it should all fit (but it will definitely tower high!). Refrigerate <em>uncovered for 2-3 hours.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> After a couple hours in the refrigerator, sift or strain a dense layer of cocoa powder all over the top. Wipe the rim of the baking dish.<strong> Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, then refrigerate for at least 8-9 more hours and up to 1 day.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Using a sharp knife, slice chilled tiramisu into servings. Wipe knife clean between cuts.<strong> A small metal serving spatula is helpful for removing the slices.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Cover leftover tiramisu and store in the refrigerator for<strong> up to 3 days.</strong>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by preheating the oven at <em>350°F (180°C).</em> Cover baking tray with parchment paper.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> First you will beat <em>two large eggs and the sugar</em>. Next you’ll add the vanilla. If you are using other extracts, such as almond extract, mix them in now. This is also when you will want to add citrus zest such as orange or lemon zest.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In another bowl, whisk together<strong> the flour, baking powder and salt.</strong> Add the dry ingredients to the wet and mix until combined.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Finally, stir in any mix-ins the almonds in this case, or any other ingredients you want to use.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> For this quantity you can shape the dough into a <em>log shape.</em> Place the logs on a parchment-lined baking sheet.<strong> Press down with your hands to flatten the logs, you want them to be 3/4-inch thick to ensure even cooking.</strong> You can also use your hands to smooth and flatten the edges of the dough logs.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Position oven rack in the <em>middle of the oven</em> and bake the dough logs for <strong>20-25 minutes at 350 degrees</strong>, until they are lightly golden. The center will be slightly soft (see notes). At this point lower the oven temperature to to <em>325°F (175°C).</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Place the cooked log on a cutting board. Slice the logs on the diagonal, pressing a sharp knife straight down into the dough.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Place the cookies back on the baking tray, cut side up. Bake the biscotti a second time, for 12-16 minutes, until golden brown and crisp.

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Place<em> 3 cups of the milk</em> along with the vanilla bean paste in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Slowly, gently, bring just to a simmer.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> 
In the meantime, place the remaining cup of milk in a large glass measuring cup (or equivalent), whisk in the sugar, then whisk in the cornstarch. Set aside.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> As the milk comes to a simmer, remove from heat, and pour the cornstarch mixture into the milk. Place back on medium heat and stir, stir, stir, until things come back up to a simmer and thicken - 10 minutes or so.<strong> The goal here is to avoid scorching the milk on the bottom of the pan.</strong> You want the <em>mixture thicker than a runny milkshake,</em> but much thinner than a frosty one. Remove from heat, stir in the salt, taste and adjust with more if needed.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Strain the mixture into a mixing bowl, let it cool for 20 minutes or so, then place in the refrigerator for a few hours until completely chilled. <strong>Don’t short-cut this step, get your mixture as cold as possible.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong>Churn the gelato per your machine’s manufacturer instructions, and serve immediately. Or, you can transfer to a container and place in a freezer for a few hours for a more structured gelato.
